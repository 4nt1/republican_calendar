## Usage

The gem offers a new class Date::Republican to represent a given moment from the start of the first french republic.

```ruby

# first day of the republic
Date::Republican.new
=> #<Date::Republican:0x007fb765185870 @day=1, @month=1, @year=1>

# a republican date before the 22-09-1792 is invalid
Date::Republican.new(-1, 1, 1)
=> ArgumentError: invalid date no year 0 in the republican calendar

# Coup of 18 brumaire
Date.new(1799, 11, 9).to_republican.to_s
=> "18 Brumaire an 8"

# Make new Date::Republican from numeric or string values
Date::Republican.parse("18 Brumaire an 8")
=> #<Date::Republican:0x007ffae1514b20 @day=18, @month=2, @year=8>

Date::Republican.new(8, 2, 18).to_s
=> "18 Brumaire an 8"

# Make the conversion in both ways (from Date to Date::Republican and vice versa)
Date.new(1799, 11, 9).to_republican.to_gregorian
=> #<Date: 1799-11-09 ((2378444j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>

# Add or substract days
Date::Republican.new + 200
=> #<Date::Republican:0x007f9e4ba5c0d0 @day=21, @month=7, @year=1>

# Check if a republican year is sextil
Date::Republican.new(3).sextil?
=> true

# Date::Republican includes Comparable
Date::Republican.new(4, 1, 1) > Date::Republican.new(4, 1, 2)
=> false


```
